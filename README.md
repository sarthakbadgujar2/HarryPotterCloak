# HarryPotterCloak

This is my first OpenCV mini project :
In this prokect how we can play with the video is shown using the cloaking. Which means Invisibility through python. 
In this project first i capture the camera live stream using the VideoCapture then i sleep a video frame for some time to capture the background.
Next i have given HSV values range to identify the color if that color comes in front of the live stream then it puts the background image on that-
-color HSV range part and the it feels like harrypotter movie magic which hides the person in particular color.
